    "An *index* refers to a data structure used to quickly find specific records of interest. For example, imagine we were looking for a specific instructor with a given ID in the \"instructor\" table. One option would be to scan the file containing the instructor tuples, and check if the tuple satisfies the condition. However, for a very large table, that might take a long time. We could also try to do **binary search**, but that would only work if the tuples were sorted by ID. \n",

We will cover more details of how indexes are built in class, and the B-Tree Notebook. **Here we will discuss how indexes can be built in PostgreSQL.**\n",
